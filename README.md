# Seg-Scale: An Unsupervised Learning GPU-Accelerated Framework for Scalable Analysis of Ultra-High-Resolution Imaging Data

The ever-increasing scale and complexity of ultra-high-resolution imaging data—spanning neuroscience, astronomy, and materials science—demands new paradigms for efficient and accurate analysis. In this paper, we propose Seg-Scale (Segmentation at Scale): a GPU-accelerated framework for scalable multidimensional data processing that synergizes state-of-the-art AI-driven methodologies with advanced high-performance computing. Specifically, our approach integrates \emph{unsupervised learning} for robust feature representation, anisotropic diffusion for adaptive noise reduction, and prompt-based segmentation with zero-shot generalization to seamlessly accommodate unseen structures. A key innovation lies in our dynamic overlap-aware tiling strategy, which preserves critical spatial relationships while maximizing parallel throughput on GPUs. This unified pipeline accelerates noise reduction $10\times$  and achieves accurate identification of over 200,000 neuron centroids in under 30 seconds—demonstrating a $40\%$ improvement in end-to-end efficiency compared to conventional methods. By delivering near-real-time performance on terabyte-scale imaging datasets, our solution presents a significant leap forward in large-scale data analysis, enabling researchers to focus on scientific insights rather than computational bottlenecks. Beyond its immediate application to cellular-level neuroimaging, this framework paves the way for broader adoption in other domains where massive, high-dimensional data streams are the norm, positioning it as a critical enabler of future breakthroughs in interdisciplinary AI-driven research.
